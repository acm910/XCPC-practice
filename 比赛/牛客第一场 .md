## 题目描述 

There are n*n* numbers a1,a2,…,an*a*1,*a*2,…,*a**n* in a group, labeled with 1,2,…,n1,2,…,*n*, and they keep competing with each other. A number competes with any other number in the group every day and loses when it is smaller than its competitor. It takes part in n−1*n*−1 competitions in total, and if it loses at least ⌈n−12⌉⌈2*n*−1⌉ competitions, it is numb with failure. Note that ⌈x⌉⌈*x*⌉ is the smallest integer y*y* such that y≥x*y*≥*x*.

So every day, there can always be some numbers that are numb with failure. As a kind mental therapist, you feel obliged to talk to them to cheer them up. So you wonder how many numbers are numb each day, which determines the amount of your work.

The numbers don't remain the same. Each day, exactly one of them practices really hard and enlarges itself. Once the number changes, it won't change until it further enlarges itself. So every day, you may face a different situation.

## 输入描述:

```
The first line of the input contains an integer TT (1≤T≤1041≤T≤104), indicating the number of test cases. For each test case:

The first line contains two integers nn (3≤n≤2×1053≤n≤2×105) and qq (1≤q≤2×1051≤q≤2×105), indicating the number of numbers in the group and the number of days for updating their values.

The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109), indicating the value of each number.

Then qq lines follow, each of which contains two integers pp (1≤p≤n1≤p≤n) and vv (1≤v≤1091≤v≤109), indicating the label of the number that is enlarged and the value by which it is increased.

It is guaranteed that both the sum of nn and the sum of qq for all test cases do not exceed 5×1055×105.
```

## 输出描述:

```
For each test case, output qq integers, indicating the number of numb numbers after each update.

## 思路：离线算法（离散化+树状数组\线段树）

先将所有可能出现的能力值进行统计，将排序后的数据离散化处理，得到共有s个数据，问题转变为维护前n - $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ 的位置，此时可以使用树状数组或者线段树维护某个大小数据出现的频率，再对树状数组进行二分，寻找该值。

## 思路：在线算法（对顶堆+维护堆顶值的个数）

核心思路就是找中位数在哪里，这可以使用对顶堆解决，维护过程中需要加入懒删除，代码较长且十分复杂。同时还要维护堆顶值的个数，最后在每次更新后得到答案。

## 题目描述 

There is a big museum consisting of n*n* rooms and some bidirectional corridors. There are at most 33 doors in each room, and the corridor outgoing from the room is behind the door. All corridors outgoing from a single room lead to different rooms. The whole museum is connected, i.e., it is possible to walk between any two rooms, possibly passing through other rooms along the way.

You are to help in setting labels on doors that will make the tour through the whole museum much easier. The idea is that if a room u*u* has du*d**u* doors leading through corridors to other rooms, these doors are labeled with numbers 1,2,…,du1,2,…,*d**u*, then all visitors will follow a simple procedure. If they are in room u*u* at the very beginning of their tour, they will choose the door labeled with 11 and pass through the corresponding corridor. If they are in room u*u* and they entered it from the corridor through the door labeled with i*i*, they will pick the door labeled with the next number (i.e., i+1*i*+1 if i<du*i*<*d**u* and 11 if i=du*i*=*d**u*) and pass through the corresponding corridor.

Now we have already set a labeling, and you need to find the number of different corridors that the visitors will pass through if they start the tour in each room, assuming they follow the rules, do not get bored easily, and walk long enough.

## 输入描述:

```
The first line contains an integer nn (3≤n≤2×1053≤n≤2×105), indicating the number of rooms in the museum.

The next nn lines contain a description of all corridors, the uu-th of which describes corridors connecting the uu-th room with others. It begins with an integer dudu (1≤du≤31≤du≤3), the number of doors in this room. Then dudu integers v1,v2,…,vduv1,v2,…,vdu (1≤vi≤n1≤vi≤n, vi≠uvi=u, and vi≠vjvi=vj if i≠ji=j) follow, giving numbers of rooms that those doors lead to, in the order of their assigned labels.

Note that all corridors are bidirectional, so if there is a door from room uu to room vv, there is a door from room vv to room uu as well.
```

## 输出描述:

```
Output nn lines, the ii-th of which contains the number of different corridors that the visitors will pass through if they start the tour in room ii.

## 思路：dfs

可以证明任何一个点出发，所构成的路径都是一个环，所以我们可以dfs判断环，注意每个通道从a->b和从b->a是两条不同的边，但在统计答案时需要把这种重复的边删去，难点在于猜测和证明其一定可以形成一个环。

# I Iron Bars Cutting

64bit IO Format: %lld

## 题目描述 

There are n*n* iron bars, where the length of the i*i*-th iron bar is ai*a**i*. These n*n* iron bars are welded together in the order of 1,2,3,…,n1,2,3,…,*n* to form a very long iron bar for some usage. Welding two adjacent iron bars creates a weld point, resulting in a total of n−1*n*−1 weld points.

Little Q needs to cut this long iron bar back into n*n* iron bars. Each time he can choose an iron bar that has at least one weld point and select a weld point to cut the iron bar into two at that weld point, then let the lengths of the resulting two iron bars be l1*l*1 and l2*l*2. The imbalance of this cut is defined as ∣l1−l2∣∣*l*1−*l*2∣, and the cost of the cut is defined as min⁡{l1,l2}×⌈log⁡2(l1+l2)⌉min{*l*1,*l*2}×⌈log2(*l*1+*l*2)⌉. Note that ∣x∣∣*x*∣ is the absolute value of x*x*, and ⌈log⁡2(y)⌉⌈log2(*y*)⌉ is the smallest integer z*z* such that 2z≥y2*z*≥*y*.

Little Q hopes that the imbalances of the n−1*n*−1 cuts, denoted as b1,b2,…,bn−1*b*1,*b*2,…,*b**n*−1, satisfy b1≥b2≥⋯≥bn−1*b*1≥*b*2≥⋯≥*b**n*−1, and the total cost of these n−1*n*−1 cuts is minimized. You need to find the minimum total cost for the first cut at the weld point between the i*i*-th and (i+1*i*+1)-th iron bars, or indicate if it is impossible to cut out n*n* iron bars, for each i=1,2,…,n−1*i*=1,2,…,*n*−1.

## 输入描述:

```
The first line of the input contains an integer TT (1≤T≤2001≤T≤200), indicating the number of test cases. For each test case:

The first line contains an integer nn (2≤n≤4202≤n≤420), indicating the number of iron bars.

The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109), indicating the lengths of the iron bars.

It is guaranteed that the sum of nn for all test cases does not exceed 420420.
```

## 输出描述:

```
For each test case, output a line containing n−1n−1 integers, the ii-th of which indicates the minimum total cost for the first cut at the weld point between the ii-th and (i+1i+1)-th iron bars, or −1−1 if it is impossible to cut out nn iron bars.
