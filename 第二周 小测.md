## A. Bricks and Bags

time limit per test: 1 second

memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

input: standard input

output: standard output



There are $n$ bricks numbered from $1$ to $n$. Brick $i$ has a weight of $a_i$.

Pak Chanek has $3$ bags numbered from $1$ to $3$ that are initially empty. For each brick, Pak Chanek must put it into one of the bags. After this, each bag must contain at least one brick.

After Pak Chanek distributes the bricks, Bu Dengklek will take exactly one brick from each bag. Let $w_j$ be the weight of the brick Bu Dengklek takes from bag $j$. The score is calculated as $|w_1 - w_2| + |w_2 - w_3|$, where $|x|$ denotes the absolute value of $x$.

It is known that Bu Dengklek will take the bricks in such a way that minimises the score. What is the maximum possible final score if Pak Chanek distributes the bricks optimally?

**Input**

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4$) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description of each test case.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($3 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of bricks.

The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$) — the weights of the bricks.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

**Output**

For each test case, output a line containing an integer representing the maximum possible final score if Pak Chanek distributes the bricks optimally.

**Note**

In the first test case, one way of achieving a final score of $6$ is to do the following:

-   Put bricks $1$, $4$, and $5$ into bag $1$.
-   Put brick $3$ into bag $2$.
-   Put brick $2$ into bag $3$.

If Pak Chanek distributes the bricks that way, a way Bu Dengklek can take the bricks is:

-   Take brick $5$ from bag $1$.
-   Take brick $3$ from bag $2$.
-   Take brick $2$ from bag $3$.

The score is $|a_5 - a_3| + |a_3 - a_2| = |3 - 5| + |5 - 1| = 6$. It can be shown that Bu Dengklek cannot get a smaller score from this distribution.

It can be shown that there is no other distribution that results in a final score bigger than $6$.

## D. Fibonaccharsis

time limit per test: 2 seconds

memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

input: standard input

output: standard output

Ntarsis has received two integers $n$ and $k$ for his birthday. He wonders how many fibonacci-like sequences of length $k$ can be formed with **$n$ as the $k$\-th element** of the sequence.

A sequence of **non-decreasing non-negative** integers is considered fibonacci-like if $f_i = f_{i-1} + f_{i-2}$ for all $i > 2$, where $f_i$ denotes the $i$\-th element in the sequence. Note that $f_1$ and $f_2$ can be arbitrary.

For example, sequences such as $[4,5,9,14]$ and $[0,1,1]$ are considered fibonacci-like sequences, while $[0,0,0,1,1]$, $[1, 2, 1, 3]$, and $[-1,-1,-2]$ are not: the first two do not always satisfy $f_i = f_{i-1} + f_{i-2}$, the latter does not satisfy that the elements are non-negative.

Impress Ntarsis by helping him with this task.

**Input**

The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$), the number of test cases. The description of each test case is as follows.

Each test case contains two integers, $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$, $3 \leq k \leq 10^9$).

It is guaranteed the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

**Output**

For each test case output an integer, the number of fibonacci-like sequences of length $k$ such that the $k$\-th element in the sequence is $n$. That is, output the number of sequences $f$ of length $k$ so $f$ is a fibonacci-like sequence and $f_k = n$. It can be shown this number is finite.

**Note**

There are $4$ valid fibonacci-like sequences for $n = 22$, $k = 4$:

-   $[6,8,14,22]$,
-   $[4,9,13,22]$,
-   $[2,10,12,22]$,
-   $[0,11,11,22]$.

For $n = 3$, $k = 9$, it can be shown that there are no fibonacci-like sequences satisfying the given conditions.

For $n = 55$, $k = 11$, $[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]$ is the only fibonacci-like sequence.

思路：不用想的太复杂，可以假设前两项 $$f1,f2$$，其系数$$a,b$$也满足斐波拉契数列，最终通过求解$$a*f1+b*f2 = n$$ 这个方程，得出最终的答案个数。

## E. Nene's Magical Matrix

time limit per test: 2 seconds

memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

input: standard input

output: standard output

The magical girl Nene has an $n\times n$ matrix $a$ filled with zeroes. The $j$\-th element of the $i$\-th row of matrix $a$ is denoted as $a_{i, j}$.

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

-   Type $1$ operation: choose an integer $i$ between $1$ and $n$ and a permutation $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ of integers from $1$ to $n$. Assign $a_{i, j}:=p_j$ for all $1 \le j \le n$ simultaneously.
-   Type $2$ operation: choose an integer $i$ between $1$ and $n$ and a permutation $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ of integers from $1$ to $n$. Assign $a_{j, i}:=p_j$ for all $1 \le j \le n$ simultaneously.

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j}$. She asks you to find the way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more than $2n$ operations.

A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).

**Input**

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 500$). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 500$) — the size of the matrix $a$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n^2$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$.

**Output**

For each test case, in the first line output two integers $s$ and $m$ ($0\leq m\leq 2n$) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of operations in your solution.

In the $k$\-th of the next $m$ lines output the description of the $k$\-th operation:

-   an integer $c$ ($c \in \{1, 2\}$) — the type of the $k$\-th operation;
-   an integer $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$) — the row or the column the $k$\-th operation is applied to;
-   a permutation $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ of integers from $1$ to $n$ — the permutation used in the $k$\-th operation.

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only should use no more than $2n$ operations. It can be shown that the maximum possible sum can always be obtained in no more than $2n$ operations.

**Note**

In the first test case, the maximum sum $s=1$ can be obtained in $1$ operation by setting $a_{1, 1}:=1$.

In the second test case, the maximum sum $s=7$ can be obtained in $3$ operations as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/184cbf71e365ce657b0a966b714d595ddd2c75d0.png)

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the matrix larger than $7$.
